Our team will ensure a smooth integration with your existing systems during the setup process, and we're constantly adding support for additional platforms.",

            question: "Will my patients talk to a robot?",
            answer: "No â€” our voice AI is designed to sound human, empathetic, and responsive. Patients often can't tell they're speaking with an AI system. We've specifically trained our voice models to handle Indian accents and multiple regional languages with natural conversational patterns.",

        {
            question: "Can I customize responses?",

            question: "How long does it take to set up?",
            answer: "Most dental practices are up and running with Kraftodent within 2-3 days. Our onboarding team handles the integration with your existing software, trains your staff, and makes sure everything is working perfectly before going live.",
        },
        {
            question: "What languages does Kraftodent support?",

            question: "How secure is patient data?",
